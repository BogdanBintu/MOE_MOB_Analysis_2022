# MOE_MOB_Analysis_2022
Analysis and visualization tools for studying the spatial organization of olfactory receptors (OR) within the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and main olfactory bulb (MOB)

There are two sections within this repository:

1. A set of functions and scripts demonstrating how to analyze the raw MERFISH data of OR expression within the MOE. 

Single OR neurons are identified and segmented and the number of EGR1 (activity marker) molecules are counted in each neuron.

Intermediate steps of the analysis are visualized within the main script file: **Example_analysis_script_MOE.ipynb**

2. A set of cuntions and scripts demonstrating how to analyze the raw MERFISH data of OR expression within the MOB. 

Glomeruli are aligned in 3D and segmented and the number of OR molecules are counted in each glomerulus.

Intermediate steps of the analysis are visualized within the main script file: **Example_analysis_script_MOB.ipynb**
